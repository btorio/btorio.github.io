What did you do this past week?

This was the first week of my senior year. I spent a lot of time looking at waitlists, trying to meet with an advisor, and changing clothes every time I went home because I looked like I ran a 5k from the heat. But more importantly, I went to all my classes, and finalized my schedule (18 hours here we go). So far, I like all of my classes. All the professors seem really great, and well-versed and passionate about their subjects. 

What's in my way?

Not much right now! I haven't taken much of a break as far as workloads and responsibilities this summer, so I'm just trying my best to not get burnt out. 

What will I do next week?

I'll be getting my first round of assignments for most of my classes. So far, I have a surprisingly little amount of homework. I'll also be signing a contract for a fall internship this semester. 

Pick of the week - for my pick of the week I'm going to share a YouTube channel called Linus Tech Tips. I know it's pretty well known, but if you're like me and you enjoy knowing about all things digital, this is just an awesome channel. This guy can give you introductions to basic tech concepts things better than anyone.
